# 2048-Game+Code
2048 is a puzzle game written by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them until reaching the number 2048. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS over a weekend, and released on March 9th, 2014 as free and open-source software. I made it using Unity and C# coding. Enjoy!
